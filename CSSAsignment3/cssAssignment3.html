The 7 wonders of the ancient world are mysterious places built/made by ancient civilizations. History fasinates me which is why I've always wanted to go back in time and see the ancient Aztec civilization bustling. They had amazing temples that were about 200 feet high made out of stone. The great wall of China was originally built to keep out invaders, but it took from 1368-1644 AD. Its 6000km long and very astonishing to walk on. The views are great. Easter Island is very mysterious to the modern world. Scientists believe it was inhabited around 1200 AD, when the famous statues of heads were carved from solidified volcanic ash. I've actually been to the Roman Colosseum, but I was young, and couldn't appreciate its wonder. It took them only 8-9 years to build, and is made from stone an concrete. It took ten thousand slaves to piece together. The Taj Mahal is very mysterious to me. Its creator's third wife died while giving birth to their 14th child, and it inspired him to build the palace. It was constructed from 1632-1653. It took 20,000 laborers contributing to get the final product. They put random structures around it during world war 2 so pilots wouldn't target it.
