		<h1>Welcome to my web page.</h1>
		<h5>(lets learn HTML!)</h5>
		
		<p>Before we start let me tell you a little about 
		myself. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time I have 
		taught this course. I was born at a very young 
		course, I hope to continue to grow in both 
		wisdom and grace but that will require effort 
		and attention to what is happening in the world 
		and in myself. I hope you learn a lot about web 
		programming and are enlightened by what we do 
		in the class. Good luck!

		<p>When writing web pages you need to make 
		sure that you are attentive to lots of 
		details like the structure and formatting 
		of the page. I want to <strong>emphasize</strong> to you the 
		importance of this.

		<p>I want to make sure that you understand 
		what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
		</p>
			<blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all 
			the small details when writing web pages. Afterall, 
			small details can make a big difference. Be conscious 
			of what you are learning and why you are learning it. 
			We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we 
			must always exert effort to learn.
